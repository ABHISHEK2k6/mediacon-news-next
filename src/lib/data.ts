    content: `Washington D.C. — In a bombshell revelation shaking the political corridors of the U.S., an
anonymous senior official from the White House has reportedly leaked a series of classified
documents suggesting that former President Donald Trump could face a third impeachment
trial within the next two weeks.

According to the leaked material, the proposed charges stem from alleged interference with
ongoing federal investigations and financial irregularities involving foreign entities postpresidency. The documents were sent to select investigative journalists late last night through an
encrypted channel, raising suspicions of an internal rift within key Republican circles.

Sources claim that a covert committee, consisting of both Democrat and a surprising number of
Republican insiders, has been quietly building a case over the past six months. “The momentum
is growing. This isn’t just political theater anymore — this time, there are receipts,” said one
insider, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The Trump legal team has yet to make an official statement, but insiders say Mar-a-Lago has
been in lockdown mode since early morning, with lawyers reportedly flying in from New York,
D.C., and Florida.

Meanwhile, social media is ablaze with speculation, while Trump supporters call it another
“deep state hoax.”

But if the leaked timeline is accurate, the formal proceedings could begin as early as next week.

    content: `Thiruvananthapuram: In a bold move towards inclusive healthcare, the Kerala Government has
announced a landmark policy to fully cover hospital treatment costs for all residents aged 50
and above, regardless of income or insurance status.

The policy, set to launch next month under the name “Swasthyam 50+”, will include coverage
for major surgeries, chronic illness treatments, diagnostics, and post-hospitalization care in both
public and selected private hospitals across the state.

Health Minister Dr.Veena George confirmed the decision during a press conference, stating:
“Kerala has one of the highest aging populations in India. This is not a welfare move—it’s a
responsibility we owe our elders.”

The initiative will be funded through a special health budget corpus and will integrate with
Aadhaar for streamlined access and fraud prevention. Senior citizens will receive a digital
health card that automatically registers treatments under the scheme.

Medical professionals across the state have praised the policy as a “visionary step,” while public
response has been overwhelmingly positive. Many have called it a model that other states
should follow.

With over 60 lakh residents estimated to benefit, Swasthyam 50+ is being hailed as a defining
moment in Kerala’s commitment to dignified, universal healthcare.`

    author: "Nisha Patel",
    date: "Nov 08, 2023",
    image: "/assets/lemon.png",
    content: `In what can only be described as the latest bizarre trend to sweep across social media, thousands
of people have taken to freezing lemons. Yes, you heard that right – freezing lemons. But why?
Well, the reason is far stranger than anyone could have anticipated.

Experts, who apparently have no other pressing matters to attend to, are claiming that freezing
lemons could unlock hidden powers that will change your life. According to viral “studies”
conducted by totally real scientists, freezing lemons may just hold the key to eternal youth,
unlimited energy, and even the ability to predict the weather.

“Freezing lemons is like unlocking their ‘superfruit’ potential,” says Dr. Lemonus Zestfield, a
self-proclaimed citrus expert. “Not only does it preserve the lemon’s natural vitamin C, but it
also activates a special ‘freeze-enhanced’ enzyme that can apparently heal broken hearts and
solve Rubik’s cubes.”

While there is no concrete evidence to back these extraordinary claims, the trend has already
gained traction among influencers, who insist that the benefits of frozen lemons extend far
beyond just being a quirky garnish for your smoothie. One influencer, who goes by the name
@LemonLover_420, claims that she “felt a wave of enlightenment” after grating a frozen lemon
over her salad.

But the real reason behind this citrus freeze trend is even more outrageous: According to
unverified reports from completely fictional sources, freezing lemons allegedly allows you to
“hack into the fruit’s memory.” Yes, memory. This means that, theoretically, you could retrieve
long-forgotten memories from your childhood just by freezing a lemon, grating it into your
morning coffee, and hoping for the best.

While medical professionals are raising eyebrows and calling for "more research" (because, of
course, this is something that needs research), the freezing lemon movement has only grown
stronger. Lemons are now being frozen, grated, and consumed in ways that have no logical
explanation. Some are even freezing whole lemons in an effort to “open the mind” and “align
their chakras,” with many swearing by the “new-found clarity” it provides.

So, whether you’re simply hopping on the bandwagon or hoping to unlock the secrets of the
universe one frozen citrus at a time, it seems clear: everyone is freezing lemons – and the reason
is, well, just a little weirder than you think.`

Anymore)`,

    content: `Winter’s here, and so is that annual pressure to “make memories” and “see the world” instead of
just hibernating with hot chocolate and unfinished New Year’s resolutions. So if you're looking
to escape the seasonal blues or just want new pics for Instagram, here are 5 totally real places to
visit this winter – because why not pretend we’re travel influencers too?

1. Gulmarg, Kashmir – AKA India’s Accidental Switzerland

Think snow, ski lifts, and you pretending to know how to ski for 2 seconds before falling flat on
your back. Bonus: every photo looks like a Windows XP wallpaper.

2. Auli, Uttarakhand – For the “I Hike, Therefore I Am” Crowd

Perfect for adventurers, honeymooners, or anyone trying to convince their friends they're
outdoorsy. Warning: side effects include sore legs and an addiction to Maggi with mountain
views.

3. Manali, Himachal Pradesh – Where Every Second Person is on a Bike Trip

Whether you're there for the snow, the hot springs, or to find yourself spiritually (spoiler: you
won’t), Manali delivers. Also, good luck finding a hotel that doesn’t have fairy lights and
"mountain vibes" in its name.

4. Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh – Cold, Remote, and Gorgeous (Just Like Your Crush)

This one’s offbeat, because you're edgy like that. If you survive the road trip without motion
sickness or mild emotional breakdowns, the views will heal you. Kind of.

5. Shillong, Meghalaya – Because Even Winter Deserves a Bit of Rain

Foggy roads, cozy cafés, and music that makes you question your Spotify choices. Shillong in
winter feels like a vintage film you didn't know you were starring in.

    Going On`,
    author: "Anand Gupta",
    date: "Sept 22, 2024",
    image: "/assets/images.png",
    content: `A shocking-but-not-really study released today by the International Institute of Pretending to
Pay Attention has confirmed what we’ve all suspected: 89% of people in Zoom meetings are
just nodding along without a clue what’s happening.

The study, which monitored over 5,000 hours of virtual meetings, found that most participants
rely on three key strategies to survive:

1. The Strategic Nod (used every 15 seconds)
2. The "Hmm, yes" Voice Unmute (to fake engagement)
3. The Pretend-You're-Frozen Face (for emergencies)

“Honestly, I zoned out after the agenda slide,” confessed one anonymous software engineer.
“But I nodded aggressively when someone said ‘synergy,’ so I think I’m good.”

The report also revealed that 45% of people multitask during calls, including replying to
memes, checking Zomato, and once, allegedly, bathing a cat. “As long as I say ‘exactly’ every
few minutes, no one questions me,” one manager proudly shared.

In a surprising twist, 17% of participants admitted they don’t even know what the meeting is
about, having clicked the link purely out of calendar anxiety. One intern revealed he’s been
attending a sales team’s daily call for three months. “I’m in HR,” he whispered.

The study concludes by recommending a new global standard: meetings must contain at least
one moment of collective confusion, and hosts should throw in a fake data chart to see who
panics.

Zoom has not commented, but sources say they're considering a new “Auto-Nod” filter for 2025.

    Starting 2026
    `,
    author: "Raktim Thakur",
    date: "Dec 16, 2023",
    image: "/assets/fifa.png",
    content: `In a surprise press release this morning, FIFA has confirmed a controversial new rule that will
allow each football team to use one Uno Reverse Card per match starting with the 2026 World
Cup.

The rule, described as a "bold step towards tactical innovation," will let teams reverse any one
referee decision, including penalties, red cards, or even goals — once per match.

FIFA spokesperson Lucas Reynard stated, “Football is evolving. If VAR can review a moment,
why can't we just Uno it and move on?” The idea was reportedly inspired by a charity match
where a child jokingly reversed a yellow card and fans went wild.

Top managers are already reacting:

 Pep Guardiola: “If this existed in 2018, we’d have three more trophies.”
 Jose Mourinho: “I’ve been reversing blame for years. Now it’s official.”
 Didier Deschamps: “Can we also reverse injuries, please?”

The card must be physically shown by the captain with a dramatic hand motion. FIFA clarified it
must be an officially licensed Uno Reverse Card — knockoffs will result in an automatic own
goal.

Some fans are furious, calling it “ridiculous” and “the death of traditional football,” while others
are already buying customized club-themed Uno cards.

Meanwhile, EA Sports has confirmed the feature will be included in the next FC26 game update,
complete with slow-motion animations and crowd chants yelling “REVERSE!”`

Social media is already ablaze with debates, hashtags like #JusticeForPrithviraj and
#EmpuraanTruthHurts trending on X (formerly Twitter). Fans are demanding a thorough
investigation, while a few fringe groups have openly criticized the film for "crossing a line."

Police have confirmed that CCTV footage from nearby areas is being analyzed, and a press

    content: `New Delhi: A group of final-year students from IIT Madras has captured global attention after
developing an ultra-affordable water purifier that’s now transforming lives in over 400 rural
villages across India.

The device, which uses a unique nano-filtration membrane powered by solar energy, can
purify up to 20 liters of water per hour without electricity or chemicals — making it a gamechanger for remote and underserved communities.

The innovation, born from a college project, was driven by a simple goal: clean water for
everyone. “We realized that while urban India was moving ahead with smart tech, many villages
still struggle for basic drinking water. That needed to change,” said lead student Riya Sharma,
who co-designed the prototype.

The team has now been awarded the prestigious Global Innovation Award 2025 by the United
Nations Development Council, beating out entries from over 60 countries. The UN praised the
project as “a shining example of scalable, student-led impact.”

NGOs and rural development agencies across India have started collaborations with the team to
scale the purifier nationwide, and the group is also mentoring engineering students in other
colleges to adapt the design for local needs.

Netizens have flooded social media with praise, calling them “The real changemakers” and
“India’s hope for a better future.”
